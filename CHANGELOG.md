## [0.5.0] — unreleased

First public release.

### Added

**Catalogue**

- Separate **hardware** and **software** catalogues: machines, peripherals, games and
  applications, each with their own fields.
- A **category tree per machine**. Every branch declares what it holds, and branches beneath it
  inherit that unless they say otherwise.
- **Machine and software models**: define an Amiga 500 or a boxed cartridge once, and every
  copy inherits its specification, contents and media.
- **What is fitted to what** — an accelerator in an A1200, a SIMM on the accelerator.
- Photographs with box, manual and media condition; loans; purchase and sale records; and
  arbitrary specification rows per entry.

**Libraries**

- Any number of libraries, private or shared, each with its own locations, companies,
  platforms, categories and models.
- Six access levels per library: **Library Viewer, Contributor, Editor, Curator, Admin,
  Owner** — from reading to owning, with membership by invitation.

**API**

- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/profile`** and **`/profile/notifications`**: your details, your password, and
  what you want to be told about.
- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/admin/settings`**: the instance settings, described rather than dumped — each
  field carries its kind, its choices and its limits, so a native client can draw the form
  without knowing the settings in advance, and a setting added later appears in an app nobody
  rebuilt. Secrets report only whether they are set.

**Instance settings**

- **Starter data** records what each fetch saw. A second table puts what the file held beside
  what is in the instance now and marks a row where they disagree — the count that was already
  there answered "what do I have" and never "am I behind".
- **Force update**, beside Save, resyncs ignoring what is already present. An ordinary fetch
  skips a slug it recognises, so a correction to a row that shipped wrong could never arrive.
  Neither touches a library.
- The log **Test** panel is gone; **Write test log** sits beside Save in Logging, so it saves
  and then writes rather than testing what was stored last time somebody pressed Save.

**Fixed**

- Choosing a company on a **model or hardware entry** narrows the platform list only when the
  thing is a machine. A machine's maker built the platform; a peripheral's usually did not — a
  Phase 5 accelerator goes in a Commodore machine — and narrowing there removed the Amiga from
  the list and reset the platform on a model that had one.

**Metadata**

- Lookup against **OpenRetro, TheGamesDB, IGDB, the Amiga Hardware Database, the Big Book of
  Amiga Hardware, TheRetroWeb, Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata**.
- Which sources answer for which branch is decided in the category tree and inherited
  downward.
- Nothing is written without review: every field and every image is offered and applied only
  when ticked.
- **Save and look up** on the entry forms, offered when the branch being filed into has a
  source switched on.

**Accounts and access**

- Local accounts, or sign-in through **LDAP / Active Directory** with group-to-role mapping.
- Registration modes: closed, public, by secret address, or by invitation — with optional
  email confirmation or administrator approval.
- API tokens for mobile and third-party clients.

**Running it**

- Browser installer with requirement checks, or a command-line install.
- Starter data for 63 machines, fetched from GitHub or the shipped copies. An instance
  running against template files older than itself still arrives working: what is a judgement
  rather than data lives in the code, and the tree is repaired on both sides if the fetched
  copy declares nothing.
- Maintenance jobs for the things that drift: orphaned photographs, photograph rows whose file
  is gone, branches with no machine, machines with no branch, blurbs left in notes.
- Syslog or file logging, SMTP with a proven-delivery check, and a `/healthz` endpoint for a
  load balancer.
