## [0.5.0] — unreleased

First public release.

### Added

**Catalogue**

- Separate **hardware** and **software** catalogues: machines, peripherals, games and
  applications, each with their own fields.
- A **category tree per machine**. Every branch declares what it holds, and branches beneath it
  inherit that unless they say otherwise.
- **Machine and software models**: define an Amiga 500 or a boxed cartridge once, and every
  copy inherits its specification, contents and media.
- **What is fitted to what** — an accelerator in an A1200, a SIMM on the accelerator.
- Photographs with box, manual and media condition; loans; purchase and sale records; and
  arbitrary specification rows per entry.

**Libraries**

- Any number of libraries, private or shared, each with its own locations, companies,
  platforms, categories and models.
- Six access levels per library: **Library Viewer, Contributor, Editor, Curator, Admin,
  Owner** — from reading to owning, with membership by invitation.

**Installing**

- **Fixed: a command line install as root left files the web server could not read.** The
  wizard runs as the web server and never had the problem; a shell does not, so
  `src/config.local.php` came out `root:root` at 0640 and the site answered 503 with nothing in
  any log. `bin/install.php` now sets the owner of the configuration and of `public/uploads`
  when it is root, taking the account from the new `[server]` section or looking for `wwwrun`,
  `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx` and `http`.
- **`bin/install.php --interactive`** asks the questions instead of needing a file, checking
  each answer as it is given and not echoing passwords. `--save-answers` writes the result out
  afterwards, so a machine done by hand can install the next one unattended.
- **`bin/install.php`** installs from an answer file instead of seven pages of questions:
  `--example` prints one, `--dry-run` checks everything and writes nothing, and the exit status
  is 0 only if the install finished. It includes the web installer for its helpers rather than
  keeping a second copy of them to drift. Every complaint about the answers is reported at once.
- The answer file is now the **response file**: `.rsp` rather than `.ini`, and the drop zone
  reads *Response configuration*. Still INI in shape, and `.ini` is still accepted by the file
  picker.
- The web installer **writes an answer file** on its review step and again at the end, and
  **reads one** on its first,
  so the second machine is one page and a drop rather than seven pages of the same answers. The
  file is checked as it lands. A complete one — credentials included, database answering —
  skips the remaining five pages and installs on the spot; one with the credentials still blank
  fills the pages in instead; an unusable one is marked and the ordinary installation carries
  on underneath. `deploy = erase` stops to be confirmed unless the file also says
  `force_erase = 1`, in both installers: an answer file gets copied between machines, and the
  collection it destroys is whichever database it happens to name that day.
- **Fixed: `delete_installer` broke the command line installer.** Everything the two share —
  the requirement checks, the database work, the answer file — was in `public/install.php`, so
  deleting the wizard took half of `bin/install.php` with it and the next run died on a missing
  require. That half now lives in `src/installer.php`, which nothing deletes.
- `delete_installer` removes `public/install.php` when the install finishes, and `sign_in`
  lands the browser on the instance already signed in as the administrator it just made. Both
  off unless the answer file turns them on.
- A section written twice in an answer file is refused. `parse_ini_string()` keeps the last and
  discards the first without a word, which for `deploy` is the difference between rebuilding a
  database and leaving it alone.
  No username or password is written into it: those come out as `change-…-here`, and a file
  still carrying one is refused rather than installed with a database user by that name.
- The answer file is INI, parsed by `parse_ini_string()` and executed never — the wizard takes
  one by upload, and `require` on an uploaded file is remote code execution wearing a hat. One
  definition, in `public/install.php`, used by both installers.
- `--quiet` now says nothing at all when it works, with the reason on stderr and a non-zero
  status when it does not. `RETROVAULT_DB_PASS` and `RETROVAULT_ADMIN_PASS` override the two
  passwords so the answer file can be templated and hold no secret, and `--answers -` reads it
  from standard input so it need not exist on disk.

**API**

- **A 401 says which of five things went wrong.** No header at all, a token nobody has heard of,
  a revoked one, an expired one, an account since disabled — all produced "Send a valid bearer
  token in the Authorization header", which is true of every one of them and useful for none. It
  sent people to check a header that was fine. The no-header case now names the proxy in front
  as a candidate, because a header that leaves the client and does not arrive is the hardest of
  these to reason about from either end.

- **Every API refusal is now in the log.** Nothing the API did reached the log page before: no
  sign-ins, no refusals, nothing — so an operator watching the log while being told "the app
  will not save" saw an empty screen. Refusals about who you are go in the security stream, the
  rest in the server stream, with the method, the path, the status and the fields complained
  about.
- **A token issued to a device is recorded** as `api.token.issued`, named after the device, so
  "which phone was that" has an answer.

- `GET` **`/admin/logs`** with the filters the web viewer offers, plus the per-channel counts
  and the events that have actually happened, so a client draws the same tabs without four
  requests. `GET` and `POST` **`/admin/maintenance`**: every check is run to answer the list,
  because the reason to press a repair is that its check found something, and the check is run
  again afterwards so the answer says what is left.

- `docs/openapi.yaml` describes `/notifications`, `/notifications/read` and `/metadata/search`,
  which it had never mentioned. The suite now compares the routes in `public/index.php` against
  the spec and fails on anything missing — or written twice, which YAML resolves by keeping the
  last and saying nothing.

- The API suite covers the settings endpoints: every field kind, the bounds, the all-or-nothing
  rule on a batch, and that a secret never comes back. 27 assertions to 71.

- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/profile`** and **`/profile/notifications`**: your details, your password, and
  what you want to be told about.
- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/admin/settings`**: the instance settings, described rather than dumped — each
  field carries its kind, its choices and its limits, so a native client can draw the form
  without knowing the settings in advance, and a setting added later appears in an app nobody
  rebuilt. Secrets report only whether they are set.

**Instance settings**

- The starter-data table **moved to the library screen**, where it answers the question people
  have. It counted the template set against the files — one answer for the whole instance — and
  now counts what a library holds against what there is to copy, beside the button that copies
  it. A row is marked only when the library has fewer; the filing tree is built once per
  platform, so its branch counts are legitimately larger. Instance settings keeps the address to
  fetch from, which is genuinely instance-wide, and the button that fetches.

- **Starter data** is one table: what this instance holds of each kind against how many the
  files held when they were last fetched, marked where they disagree. Every sync records both
  numbers and writes the local ones into the server log, so "when did the peripherals go from 4
  to 21" has an answer. An install syncs, so the record exists from the first day.
- **Force update**, beside Save, resyncs ignoring what is already present. An ordinary fetch
  skips a slug it recognises, so a correction to a row that shipped wrong could never arrive.
  Neither touches a library.
- The log **Test** panel is gone; **Write test log** sits beside Save in Logging, so it saves
  and then writes rather than testing what was stored last time somebody pressed Save.

**Fixed**

- A maintenance job reporting **what PHP will accept**: `post_max_size`, `upload_max_filesize`,
  `memory_limit`, which `php.ini` is actually loaded and under which SAPI. It flags an
  `upload_max_filesize` above `post_max_size` — which can never be reached, because the smaller
  number caps the whole request — and limits too low for a photograph of a boxed machine. The
  installer checked this once and is then deleted, which left no way to ask a running instance.

- **A command line install switched on no metadata sources.** The wizard has always enabled the
  ones needing no account; `bin/install.php` never did, so an instance built from a response
  file came up with nothing to look titles up with and no sign it was meant to have any. Both
  now share `installer_enable_metadata_sources()`. `metadata_sources` in the response file says
  whether to, and the wizard asks on its settings step — ticked, which is what it has always
  done without asking.

- A maintenance job for **specification names whose machine is gone**. Deleting a library takes
  its platforms and leaves the vocabulary behind pointing at rows that no longer exist —
  `ON DELETE SET NULL` on the category side, nothing at all on this one. Nothing read them and
  nothing counted them, and they accumulated: 4,552 on a database that had been used for a
  while.
- The maintenance API sent an **empty message for every job**. `maintenance_result()` calls it
  `note` and the endpoint read `message`, so the native screen showed a count and no sentence.

- **Specification names read 1158 against 589 on a freshly installed instance**, in red, with
  nothing wrong. `seed_library_hardware()` copies the interface vocabulary for a library's own
  platforms — a library with platforms and not the words for what plugs into them cannot
  describe a card — so the table grows by roughly the file's size with every library made. The
  count now takes the template rows only, and holds still as libraries are added.

- The **peripheral model count** on the settings screen read 0 while twenty-one were filed. It
  tested `role = 'peripheral'` on the model's own branch, and the tree declares that kind on the
  branch that means it — Expansions — with everything under it inheriting. A model is either a
  machine or a part, so it is counted as the counterpart of the machine line.
- Choosing a company on a **model or hardware entry** narrows the platform list only when the
  thing is a machine. A machine's maker built the platform; a peripheral's usually did not — a
  Phase 5 accelerator goes in a Commodore machine — and narrowing there removed the Amiga from
  the list and reset the platform on a model that had one.

**Metadata**

- Lookup against **OpenRetro, TheGamesDB, IGDB, the Amiga Hardware Database, the Big Book of
  Amiga Hardware, TheRetroWeb, Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata**.
- Which sources answer for which branch is decided in the category tree and inherited
  downward.
- Nothing is written without review: every field and every image is offered and applied only
  when ticked.
- **Save and look up** on the entry forms, offered when the branch being filed into has a
  source switched on.

**Accounts and access**

- Local accounts, or sign-in through **LDAP / Active Directory** with group-to-role mapping.
- Registration modes: closed, public, by secret address, or by invitation — with optional
  email confirmation or administrator approval.
- API tokens for mobile and third-party clients.

**Running it**

- Browser installer with requirement checks, or a command-line install.
- Starter data for 63 machines, fetched from GitHub or the shipped copies. An instance
  running against template files older than itself still arrives working: what is a judgement
  rather than data lives in the code, and the tree is repaired on both sides if the fetched
  copy declares nothing.
- Maintenance jobs for the things that drift: orphaned photographs, photograph rows whose file
  is gone, branches with no machine, machines with no branch, blurbs left in notes.
- Syslog or file logging, SMTP with a proven-delivery check, and a `/healthz` endpoint for a
  load balancer.
