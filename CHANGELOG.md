## [0.5.0] — unreleased

First public release.

### Added

**Catalogue**

- Separate **hardware** and **software** catalogues: machines, peripherals, games and
  applications, each with their own fields.
- A **category tree per machine**. Every branch declares what it holds, and branches beneath it
  inherit that unless they say otherwise.
- **Machine and software models**: define an Amiga 500 or a boxed cartridge once, and every
  copy inherits its specification, contents and media.
- **What is fitted to what** — an accelerator in an A1200, a SIMM on the accelerator.
- Photographs with box, manual and media condition; loans; purchase and sale records; and
  arbitrary specification rows per entry.

**Libraries**

- Any number of libraries, private or shared, each with its own locations, companies,
  platforms, categories and models.
- Six access levels per library: **Library Viewer, Contributor, Editor, Curator, Admin,
  Owner** — from reading to owning, with membership by invitation.

**Installing**

- **`bin/install.php`** installs from an answer file instead of seven pages of questions:
  `--example` prints one, `--dry-run` checks everything and writes nothing, and the exit status
  is 0 only if the install finished. It includes the web installer for its helpers rather than
  keeping a second copy of them to drift. Every complaint about the answers is reported at once.
- The web installer **writes an answer file** on its review step and again at the end, and
  **reads one** on its first,
  so the second machine is one page and a drop rather than seven pages of the same answers. The
  file is checked as it lands. A complete one — credentials included, database answering —
  skips the remaining five pages and installs on the spot; one with the credentials still blank
  fills the pages in instead; an unusable one is marked and the ordinary installation carries
  on underneath. `deploy = erase` stops to be confirmed unless the file also says
  `force_erase = 1`, in both installers: an answer file gets copied between machines, and the
  collection it destroys is whichever database it happens to name that day.
- A section written twice in an answer file is refused. `parse_ini_string()` keeps the last and
  discards the first without a word, which for `deploy` is the difference between rebuilding a
  database and leaving it alone.
  No username or password is written into it: those come out as `change-…-here`, and a file
  still carrying one is refused rather than installed with a database user by that name.
- The answer file is INI, parsed by `parse_ini_string()` and executed never — the wizard takes
  one by upload, and `require` on an uploaded file is remote code execution wearing a hat. One
  definition, in `public/install.php`, used by both installers.
- `--quiet` now says nothing at all when it works, with the reason on stderr and a non-zero
  status when it does not. `RETROVAULT_DB_PASS` and `RETROVAULT_ADMIN_PASS` override the two
  passwords so the answer file can be templated and hold no secret, and `--answers -` reads it
  from standard input so it need not exist on disk.

**API**

- The API suite covers the settings endpoints: every field kind, the bounds, the all-or-nothing
  rule on a batch, and that a secret never comes back. 27 assertions to 71.

- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/profile`** and **`/profile/notifications`**: your details, your password, and
  what you want to be told about.
- `GET`/`PATCH` **`/admin/settings`**: the instance settings, described rather than dumped — each
  field carries its kind, its choices and its limits, so a native client can draw the form
  without knowing the settings in advance, and a setting added later appears in an app nobody
  rebuilt. Secrets report only whether they are set.

**Instance settings**

- **Starter data** is one table: what this instance holds of each kind against how many the
  files held when they were last fetched, marked where they disagree. Every sync records both
  numbers and writes the local ones into the server log, so "when did the peripherals go from 4
  to 21" has an answer. An install syncs, so the record exists from the first day.
- **Force update**, beside Save, resyncs ignoring what is already present. An ordinary fetch
  skips a slug it recognises, so a correction to a row that shipped wrong could never arrive.
  Neither touches a library.
- The log **Test** panel is gone; **Write test log** sits beside Save in Logging, so it saves
  and then writes rather than testing what was stored last time somebody pressed Save.

**Fixed**

- The **peripheral model count** on the settings screen read 0 while twenty-one were filed. It
  tested `role = 'peripheral'` on the model's own branch, and the tree declares that kind on the
  branch that means it — Expansions — with everything under it inheriting. A model is either a
  machine or a part, so it is counted as the counterpart of the machine line.
- Choosing a company on a **model or hardware entry** narrows the platform list only when the
  thing is a machine. A machine's maker built the platform; a peripheral's usually did not — a
  Phase 5 accelerator goes in a Commodore machine — and narrowing there removed the Amiga from
  the list and reset the platform on a model that had one.

**Metadata**

- Lookup against **OpenRetro, TheGamesDB, IGDB, the Amiga Hardware Database, the Big Book of
  Amiga Hardware, TheRetroWeb, Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata**.
- Which sources answer for which branch is decided in the category tree and inherited
  downward.
- Nothing is written without review: every field and every image is offered and applied only
  when ticked.
- **Save and look up** on the entry forms, offered when the branch being filed into has a
  source switched on.

**Accounts and access**

- Local accounts, or sign-in through **LDAP / Active Directory** with group-to-role mapping.
- Registration modes: closed, public, by secret address, or by invitation — with optional
  email confirmation or administrator approval.
- API tokens for mobile and third-party clients.

**Running it**

- Browser installer with requirement checks, or a command-line install.
- Starter data for 63 machines, fetched from GitHub or the shipped copies. An instance
  running against template files older than itself still arrives working: what is a judgement
  rather than data lives in the code, and the tree is repaired on both sides if the fetched
  copy declares nothing.
- Maintenance jobs for the things that drift: orphaned photographs, photograph rows whose file
  is gone, branches with no machine, machines with no branch, blurbs left in notes.
- Syslog or file logging, SMTP with a proven-delivery check, and a `/healthz` endpoint for a
  load balancer.
