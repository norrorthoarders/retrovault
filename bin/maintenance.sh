# RetroVault housekeeping: the jobs that keep tables and directories from growing

#
#   ./bin/maintenance.sh              prune the sign-in log, report orphaned files
#   ./bin/maintenance.sh --delete     also delete the orphaned files
#   ./bin/maintenance.sh --days 90    keep 90 days of sign-in log instead of 30
#
# Suggested cron entry:
#   15 4 * * * /opt/retrovault/bin/maintenance.sh >> /var/log/retrovault-maintenance.log 2>&1
#
# This exists because the pruning was reachable and never reached.
# throttle_prune() has been there since rate limiting landed, exposed as
# `php bin/migrate.php prune`, and nothing scheduled it - so auth_log grew one row
# per sign-in attempt for ever on every install. A function nobody calls is not a
# feature, and the fix is a line in a crontab, not more code.
#
# Reporting orphans rather than deleting them by default is deliberate: a file
# nothing points at is usually a deleted entry, and occasionally a restore that
# has not finished. The second case wants looking at, not tidying away.
