/**
 * Maintenance jobs.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing go wrong in a catalogue this shape. Rows drift out of
 * agreement with each other - an entry filed under a kind that was deleted, a
 * card fitted to a machine in another library, a photograph on disk that nothing
 * points at any more. And the database drifts out of agreement with the schema,
 * usually because a migration was interrupted.
 *
 * Neither shows up as an error. They show up as a page that is quietly missing
 * something, months later, with no way to tell whether it was ever there. So
 * these are checks first: every job says what it found before anything is
 * offered that would change it.
 *
 * Every repair has a check, never the other way round. A repair that cannot be
 * previewed is a repair nobody should press.
 *
 * Scope is either 'instance' - the whole database, administrators only - or
 * 'library', which an owner or a curator can run on a library they hold. The
 * split is not about difficulty: a library job touches rows inside one library
 * and can be reasoned about by the person who owns it, while an instance job
 * reads across everybody's shelves or changes structure.
