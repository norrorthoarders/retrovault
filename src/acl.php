 * Who can see and change what.

 * Two things decide it, deliberately independent of each other:
 *
 *   1. The instance role. 'admin' may configure the system - authentication,
 *      metadata sources, accounts, shared taxonomy. 'user' may not. That is the
 *      whole of what the role governs.
 *
 *   2. Membership of a library. A library is the thing somebody owns or shares;
 *      a platform is only the machine an entry runs on. What a person calls
 *      their collection is everything they can reach across every library,
 *      which is a view rather than a table.
 *
 * An administrator gets no automatic sight of a private library. They can grant
 * themselves membership in one step, and that grant records who made it, so it
 * stays visible afterwards. Pretending the system could stop someone holding
 * shell and database access would be a comfortable lie; making such access
 * deliberate and legible is worth more than pretending to prevent it.
 *
 * Every item query funnels through library_filter_sql(), so the rule lives in
 * one place rather than being repeated across twenty controllers.
