-- What kind of machine a platform holds is no longer recorded on the platform:
-- it is read from the machine models filed under it, which carry the same fact
-- and are the ones that decide.


-- Hardware makers. Kept apart from `companies`, which is studios and
-- publishers: Commodore made machines and never published a game, and putting
-- them in one list makes both harder to read.

-- Everything else that used to be here is starter data, and moved to
-- db/seed-templates.sql. The line is whether removing it breaks the software or
-- merely leaves the catalogue empty: auth methods and platform classes are
-- structure, and a Commodore Amiga is a fact about the world.

-- The installer offers the starter data as a choice, and an instance that
-- declines it starts genuinely empty rather than pre-filled with somebody
-- else's idea of a collection.
